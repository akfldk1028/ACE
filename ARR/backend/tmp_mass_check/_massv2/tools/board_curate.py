"""The selection board, assembled from the ledgers instead of by hand.

The board was curated manually three times in one evening, and each time a
family of near-identical partis slipped through in a different way. This
tool owns the whole path now: it collects every juried result (both tracks,
every round), computes each passer's composition family from its sentence,
keeps the best-scored member per family per track, and emits the board key.
Rendering and publishing read that key; nobody picks tiles by eye again.
