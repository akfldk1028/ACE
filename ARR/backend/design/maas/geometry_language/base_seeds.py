Most seeds deliberately expand from the exact same unit Box; they are semantic

    and the size arrives later, when the compiled solid is fitted to a host.
    That is the difference between this executor and massv2, and it is where

    metres from its first word and the legal line only ever CUTS it. A seed

    fill it on its limiting axis, so the proportion that IS the seed's
