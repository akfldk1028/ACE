"""Canonical base-volume and plan-chassis taxonomy for executable geometry.

The taxonomy is intentionally independent of program use, BOOK projection,
roof phenotype and VLM judgement.  It gives every exact AST a stable answer to
two different questions:

* which primitive proportion it starts from (``base_seed``), and
* which plan relation the compiled mass actually forms (``chassis``).

Keeping those axes separate prevents materially different core programs from
collapsing into a synthetic ``unknown`` bucket during portfolio selection.
