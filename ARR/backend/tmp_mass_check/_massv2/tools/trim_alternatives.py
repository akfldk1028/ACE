"""Two ways to spend area, and what each does to a declared gap.

`fill` brings a scheme back under its brief by scaling the whole composition
about one shared anchor (`_wider`, fill.py:492). That scales the distance between
volumes along with their size, so a lane declared in metres is spent as a
proportion: kr_uijeongbu_art_library declares 2.43 m and delivers 1.87.

Two alternatives, measured on that sentence rather than argued:

  - sliding the volumes apart, which the previous commit claimed costs no
    건축면적 because 건축면적 is a projection. On an unbounded plane that is
    true; on this parcel it is false. The volumes move out of the envelope and
    are clipped - 394 m2 falls to 363, 320, 330, and the ground gap goes to zero
    because a volume is clipped away entirely.

  - shrinking each volume where it stands, which spends the same area and widens
    the lane instead of closing it: x0.95 gives 355.8 m2 and a 2.35 m gap against
    the 1.87 m the shared anchor leaves, still lawful.

The second is the candidate. It is not a drop-in: scaling a volume about its own
centre breaks contact with whatever it rests on, which is the reason the shared
anchor is there. The scoped form is that a volume standing on the ground and
carrying nothing may shrink in place, and everything else keeps the anchor.
