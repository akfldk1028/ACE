"""The VLM judging stage, wired to a run instead of run beside it.

Every part of this existed and none of it was in the delivery path. The run
selects with numeric leximin (`select.choose`), and the judges - who found the
entry masses nine of ten blind, and failed `sg_interlace` while the selector
kept picking it - only ever existed when a session spawned them by hand.

This closes that gap as a stage: it takes a finished run, renders the
selector's chosen masses as anonymous tiles under the stored rubric
(`inputs/judge-prompts.json` - fixed, never edited between rounds), and emits
the judging prompt plus a scoring template. The judges themselves are
subagents; the session runs them and writes their RANKING lines back with
`--score`, and this tool then writes `vlm-shortlist.json` naming the masses
the judges kept.

    python tools/vlm_shortlist.py <run> [count]          # stage tiles + prompt
    python tools/vlm_shortlist.py <run> --score r1.txt r2.txt [r3.txt]

The result is the sheet order for the final drawing: gates decide what may
stand, cells decide what is comparable, judges decide what is shown.
