"""A mass as an ordered list of operations on a site-derived seed.

The archive repeated itself because the vocabulary was sixty-one finished
compositions - volume coordinates, authored once - and everything downstream
only resized and repositioned them. Sixteen grid cells came back as sixteen
variants of the same catalogue rather than sixteen buildings. A catalogue can
only ever be re-sorted.

So the unit of authorship is a sentence, not a picture. BIG publish their own
partis exactly this way, one operation per diagram caption - 79&Park is
EXTRUSION -> POROSITY -> DAYLIGHT -> LANDMARK - and every one of OMA's fifteen
patents in *Content* is a transformation of a known type rather than a form
from nothing. Earlier corpus preferences for unequal bodies were encoded as
universal restrictions. They are not universal: repeated equal bodies can
organize different frontages, overlaps and courts. Authored relations must be
executed and checked rather than silently replaced with preferred proportions.

The seed comes from the parcel, so the site is present from the first move
rather than arriving at the end as a cutter. The executor owns supported
geometry and parameter semantics; site and structural screens remain separate.
What the author chooses is which
operations, in what order, and toward what on this particular site. Magnitude
is geometric; direction is programmatic - Seattle's shear is 0.26 of its plan
depth, and its engineers state the direction was picked "not on structural
balance but rather to maximize views and capture desired light and shadow".
