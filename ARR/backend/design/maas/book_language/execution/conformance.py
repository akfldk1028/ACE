"""Which BOOK words massv2 has implemented for itself, and whether anyone said so.

The BOOK is the language; a second implementation of one of its words is a
dialect. A dialect is allowed - `shear` really is used both ways and the
sentences that rely on each are already written - but it has to be written
down, because the cost of an undeclared one is paid downstream by a jury who
sees a building that does not match its sentence and marks the concept down
without being able to say why.

`undeclared_divergences` is the number this package exists to bring to zero.
It does not fall by deleting a verb; it falls by somebody reading the two
implementations of one word and either reconciling them or recording the
reading in `DECLARED_DIVERGENCES`.
