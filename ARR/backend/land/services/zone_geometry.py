"""How much of a parcel lies in each 용도지역.

`getLandUseAttr` names the designations a parcel touches and says whether it is
포함 / 저촉 / 접함, but it never says how much. Every branch of 국토계획법 제84조
needs the how-much: the capacity of a parcel spanning two zones is the area of
each part times that part's own limit, and without the split there is nothing to
multiply. Lacking it, `zoning_mapper` had been taking the strictest limit over
the whole parcel, which is not a rule the statute contains - on 의정부
4115011300106840001 that read a 제2종일반주거지역 parcel merely 저촉된 by
자연녹지지역 as if all 2499 m2 of it were green, at 20% and 100% instead of 60%
and 250%.

So the split is measured, from the same Vworld WFS the parcel boundary already
comes from. `LT_C_UQ111` is the 용도지역 layer; each feature carries `uname` and
the year it was designated.

Nothing here decides anything legal. It returns areas. What the areas mean is
`zoning_mapper`'s job, and which article applies is written in
`land/data/zone_overlap_rules.json` rather than in either.

    Three things this does that a naive loop does not.

    It intersects. The layer is fetched by bounding box, so a zone that merely
    abuts the parcel arrives looking exactly like one that covers it, and only
    the intersection tells them apart - which is the same distinction
    `getLandUseAttr`'s 접함 makes, arrived at independently.

    It unions per name before measuring. The same 용도지역 comes back as several
    features, designated in different years; added up they would count the
    overlap twice and report more zone than there is parcel.

    It measures in metres. Areas in degrees are not areas, and they are wrong by
