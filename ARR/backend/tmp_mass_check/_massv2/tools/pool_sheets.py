"""Every physics-passing mass of a run, drawn - so a person can actually look.

The selection showed 12 of 3,482 and the user rightly asked to see the rest:
the pool had eleven hundred masses of five storeys and more that no sheet
ever surfaced. This renders the WHOLE plausible pool as numbered contact
sheets (48 tiles each), ordered tall-first within family order, with storeys
and FAR on every tile - the browsing surface for a human sweep and for
auditor subagents.
