"""Where on the parcel the building sits.

Ground take says how much of the site a scheme claims and the void band says
what kind of figure it is, and neither says where it stands. `seat_on_site`
answers that once, for every scheme, by putting it on the buildable centroid -
so every mass in the archive is centred, and a low-coverage scheme that could
have sat against the street, or held one corner and left a yard, sits in the
middle of an even margin instead.

That is a real architectural decision being made by default. A building pushed
to the road edge makes a forecourt behind it; the same building pushed back
makes a front garden; held to one side it leaves a yard wide enough to be a
place rather than a gap. Those are different proposals, not different pictures
of one proposal.

The anchors are read off the parcel rather than listed here, so this means the
same thing on any site: the buildable polygon's own centre, and the extremes of
its two principal directions. A square site and a long thin one both give four
positions that an architect would recognise, without a number being chosen.
