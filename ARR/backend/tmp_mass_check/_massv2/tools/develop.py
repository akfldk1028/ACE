"""The development loop: grow a chosen sentence instead of breeding new ones.

OMA makes a hundred and fifty models and then develops ONE through dozens of
passes; this pipeline only ever generated. The visible cost was measured all
week - first-legal-fit partis that read as diagrams next to the offices'
tuned models. This tool is the missing half: take a board winner, mutate its
OWN sentence locally (proportions, extremity, FAR attainment), deliver every
mutant down the same legal path, and stage parent-vs-mutant pairs for blind
pairwise judging - keep the child only when a judge prefers it.

Without a payload, deterministic mutants vary by index. An authored payload
provides complete child records bound to the exact scored parent instead.
