"""
Zoning Mapper - maps zoning zone names to BCR/FAR limits.

Loads static data from data/zoning_limits.json.

When a parcel spans more than one 용도지역, the limits come from 국토계획법 제84조
and depend on how much of the parcel is in each - see `resolve_limits`. The rule
this used to apply, the strictest limit over the whole parcel, is not in the
statute: it read 의정부 4115011300106840001, a 제2종일반주거지역 parcel merely
저촉된 by 자연녹지지역, as green throughout, at 20% and 100% where the dominant
zone allows 60% and 250%.

    Given a list of zone names, compute the effective BCR/FAR limits.

    One zone is one zone. More than one is 국토계획법 제84조, and every branch of
    it is a question about area: the parcel's capacity is each part's area times
    that part's own limit. Pass `zone_areas` (m2 per zone name, from
    `zone_geometry.parcel_zone_split`) and that is what is computed.

    Both branches of 제84조 give the same capacity and differ in what governs the
    *other* restrictions:

      제84조제1항  smallest part at or under the 시행령 size - 건폐율 and 용적률
                  are area-weighted, and 그 밖의 건축 제한 follows the largest
                  part's zone.
      제84조제3항  a 녹지지역 is involved - 각각의 용도지역 규정을 각각 적용, so
                  every part keeps its own other-restrictions too.

    Weighting and applying-each agree on capacity because applying each part its
    own limit and totalling is sum(area_i x limit_i), which over the parcel area
    is the weighted mean. The branch is still reported, because a caller asking
    about height or setback needs to know which zone answers.

    Without `zone_areas` the split is unknown, and an unknown split cannot be
    guessed - the previous guess, the strictest limit, understated this parcel by
    a factor of 2.5. The zones are returned with `bcr_limit`/`far_limit` as None
    and `needs_zone_areas` set, so a caller can see it has to go and measure.
