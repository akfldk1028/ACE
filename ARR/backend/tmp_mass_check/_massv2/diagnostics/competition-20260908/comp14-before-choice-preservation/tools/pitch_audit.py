"""Does a roof come out at the pitch the sentence declared?

`skew` was found declaring 24 degrees and building 38.7, because the verb handed
`degrees / 30` to a matrix whose amount is a tangent. `pitch` is the other number
in this language with a geometric meaning an architect can check - a slope, rise
per unit of run, 1.0 being 45 degrees - and it is capped on the way through:
`gable` and `mansard` both hold the roof to a storey or two, so a steep pitch
declared on a wide body is delivered shallower than it was written.

That cap is deliberate and this does not argue with it. It measures how far the
declared number and the built one have drifted apart, per sentence, so the
distance is a fact rather than an assumption.
