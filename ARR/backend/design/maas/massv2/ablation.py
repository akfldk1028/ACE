"""Take one word out of the sentence and see whether the building notices.

`postcondition` asks whether a word changed the mass *at the moment it was
said* - it runs the sentence forward and compares consecutive frames, at the
size it was authored, before the growth loop and before the legal clip. That is
the right question for finding a word that was never doing anything, and it is
the wrong one for finding a word whose effect does not survive to the drawing.

The two come apart because everything after the sentence can undo it. `fill`
grows the composition toward the parcel's own capacity; the compiler cuts every
band to the sunlight envelope. A shear measured 0.35 unclipped and 0.04 after
the clip on the same scheme, which was recorded at the time as the gate being
right - the two masses really were nearly the same building. So a word can pass
the postcondition and still be absent from what a person is shown.

This asks the other question, the one the critics are actually answering:

    remove this word from the sentence, run the whole pipeline again, and
    compare the two delivered masses.

A word that changes nothing when removed is not in the building, whatever it
did in the middle of the sentence. Removing a word can also break the words
after it - `on: "west_islands"` names a part that a removed `split` never made,
and `_scope` then finds nothing and the operation is silent. That is not a flaw
in the measurement, it is the measurement: a word the rest of the sentence
depends on is load-bearing, and the number says so.

Cost is one extra pipeline run per word, at sentence level rather than per
delivered variant - about three runs for a typical sentence. The coverage and
siting copies of one sentence share its words, so they share this number.

    Sixteen of the faults in the last critique round were `gaps-not-present`,
    and three of the four judges independently named the same thing: a verb ran,
    the gate said it changed the mass, and the thing the sentence was about -
    the lane, the street, the space between - is not in the drawing. The two
    lowest-scoring alternatives of sixteen both say volumes stand apart and both
    draw them fused; each lost every pair it appeared in.

    It is checked on the delivered mass because that is where it goes wrong. The
    executor sets the gap by construction, so at authoring size it is always
    there; the growth loop widens the pieces back toward each other and the
    legal clip trims what overhangs, and between them the gap closes.

    `gap` in a sentence is multiplied by JOINT_CLEARANCE_M, which is how a
