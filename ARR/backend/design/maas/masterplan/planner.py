    # won and the basement came out 2,500 m2 at 64.1/108.7 m2 per stall with a straight ramp. Left to
    # choose, the engine takes a practice-sized 1,468 m2 plate at 44.5/50.6 with the curved ramp and
    # dead-end aisles - which is also what the reference drawing does (ALT1's aisle dead-ends at the
    # west). So the loop earns points instead: `rows.WEIGHTS["w_loop"]` prices it in cars, and the
    # basement ranking takes the loop at equal cars. No statute requires 회차 (시행규칙 제6조·제11조
    # have no such clause); what the law does draw at 50 stalls is the two-lane aisle or separated
    # entry/exit ramps (제6조제1항제5호사목1)·제11조제1항) and the 5.5 m entrance (제4호), both of which
