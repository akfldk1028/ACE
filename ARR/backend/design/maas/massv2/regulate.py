"""Make the parts land on a few lines, instead of only measuring whether they did.

`composition.py` reads the Akin-Moustapha finding - a small set of regulating
elements explains where every part sits - and scores a mass on it. Scoring is
half the idea. The architects they watched did not measure alignment after the
fact; they DREW to axes, and that is why the results read as one thing.

A generated mass has every part almost aligned: a bar's face lands 0.7 m off
its neighbour's, a tier's top sits 0.4 m above a storey line, a wing is turned
1.6 degrees off the parcel. None of it is wrong enough to fail a gate and all
of it is visible - it is exactly the difference between a drawing that reads
as disciplined and one that reads as approximate. The architect's word for
what is missing is 정갈함.

So this snaps what is nearly true into being true:

  * bearings, to the axes the composition already commits to (the parcel's own
    open-side direction and the leading body's), within a few degrees;
  * faces, to the lines a face of the leading body already occupies;
  * heights, to whole storeys.

It moves nothing far. The tolerance is the width of the slack a random
parameter leaves, not a design decision: a part that genuinely sits at its own
angle keeps it, because it is further off than the tolerance. And it runs
BEFORE the legal fit, so the envelope still has the last word on what stands.
