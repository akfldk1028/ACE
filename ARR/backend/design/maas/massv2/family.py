"""The composition family of a sentence, computed instead of eyeballed.

Three times in one day a board was curated by hand because near-identical
partis stacked up - six plinth-and-turned-tower schemes side by side, from
three authors who were told to be different. Personas do not partition a
model's distribution; a key does. This module owns the question "are these
two sentences the same building?" at the level a jury reads - physical
principle, not detail - so staging, boards and the cell selector can prefer
one-per-family without anyone looking.

Born as a workspace tool beside the board curator; moved here the day the
audit showed the delivered thirty-two picks were fifteen families, one of
them seated six times - the selector deduped by sentence NAME, and a family
is exactly what a set of names has in common.

The key is (opener, move families, stature band): which word stands the
volume up, which *kinds* of moves act on it (not their parameters), and
whether the body is low, mid or tall. plinth_turned_tower, grid_realigned
_tower and plinth_slender_turned all collapse to (extrude, relational, low)
- which is exactly what both judges said of them.
