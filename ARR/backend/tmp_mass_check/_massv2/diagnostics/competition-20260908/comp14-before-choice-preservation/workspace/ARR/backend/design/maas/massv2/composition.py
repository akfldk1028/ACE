"""Is this mass composed, or is it parts that happen to be legal?

Every gate in this package answers a question about a single body: can it
stand, does it hold a room, is it inside the envelope. None of them asks the
question an architect asks first - do these parts belong to one another - and
so a field of six equal boxes, each of them lawful and standing, comes back
through the funnel as six good answers and reads on the sheet as rubble.

The literature has one operational answer. Akin and Moustapha watched six
architects massing for two hours each and found the mechanism that structured
every session was the REGULATING ELEMENT: an alignment axis, a symmetry line,
a shared face, a datum. Volumes were freely added and removed, and what
survived the additions - what made the result read as one thing - was that a
small set of these elements explained where every part sat. Their words: the
architects "preserved and even reinforced the underlying structure through
regulating elements".

That is measurable, and this module measures it:

    parts explained by the FEWEST elements that explain them all.

A composition of eight bodies whose faces land on three lines is composed. The
same eight bodies on eight lines of their own are a pile. The second half of
the reading is hierarchy - one body large enough to be the building and the
rest subordinate to it - which is the oldest rule in composition and the one a
random grammar breaks first, because equal parts have no primary.

Neither number is a gate. A gate answers yes or no about physics or law; this
answers "how strongly is this composed", which is the selector's question and
the jury's, and it belongs where they can read it.
