"""Bake the board's tiles and track sheets from board-key.json.

The board was re-baked by hand once (rule 0: after an executor change the
tiles are re-rendered before anyone looks). Republishing is a routine now,
so the baking is a tool: every overseas entry is rebuilt with the code as it
stands and drawn as a single tile plus its place in the track sheet. Korean
entries are rebuilt the same way when their brief is available; otherwise an
existing tile is kept and reported, never silently redrawn from the wrong
schedule.

    python tools/board_render.py            # rebake O tiles + both sheets
