"""Let the model author massing programs, not draw geometry.

CoMa (arXiv 2601.08464) tried the direct route - a VLM emitting footprint
polygons with bottom and top elevations, the same representation this pipeline
uses - and reported Site IoU 0.05 with frequent self-intersecting polygons. The
lesson is not that models cannot do massing; it is that they should not be asked
for coordinates. Asked instead for a short program in a vocabulary with a
deterministic executor, the same models do well (MeshCoder, CADSmith).

So the model writes `place(role, size, at, rotation)` calls. Every number it
emits is a fraction of the parcel's own limits rather than a metre value, which
keeps its answers parcel-independent and keeps it from having to reason about
UTM coordinates - the thing frontier models are measurably worst at
(GeoGramBench: 90% on basic geometric reasoning, 39% on complex abstract).

The legal gate stays deterministic. 3DCodeBench (Google DeepMind) measured that
a code-feedback loop lifts executability by 27 points and leaves shape quality
flat, so the model is not asked to satisfy the law - it is asked to compose.
