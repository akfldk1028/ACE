"""Choose the sheet an architect would actually look at.

Eighty-eight masses of which forty were distinct compositions is not a portfolio,
it is a contact sheet with the same building printed four times. Filling a grid
cell is a label; the architect chooses between buildings.

Three rules, in order:

  A mass that is lawful but not occupiable is not an option. That judgement is
  `plausibility`, which uses the project's own floor-viability rule.

  A composition seen twice *in one cell* is one composition, and the signature
  is scale-free so that two drawings of the same idea collapse. It is not
  applied across cells: ground take is one of the grid's two axes, so a scheme
  carried along that axis has moved, not repeated. Deduping globally deleted
  the move before the cells were ever looked at - measured on the Uijeongbu
  parcel, raked_bar stood lawful and occupiable in four different cells at an
  articulation of 0.309 and only one copy survived, which handed
  dispersed|solid_body to a scheme scoring 0.280.

  One per grid cell, and the one kept is the most articulate. Cells are filled
  scarcest-first, and a cell prefers a composition no other cell has taken, so
  an abundant cell cannot spend the only occupant a thin cell had.

    got that wrong in opposite ways.

    Unbounded, it is not an objective about the ground at all. With 연면적 fixed,
    건폐율 is 연면적 over storeys over parcel, so `1 - ground_take` is monotone in

    So: normalise each objective across the pool, then compare candidates by
    their objectives sorted worst-first. A scheme wins by having no weak side,
    not by having one strong one. This is the criterion behind T-DominO (Gaier,
    Stoddart, Villaggi, Bentley, PPSN 2022), which reports that a quarter of
    NSGA-II's solutions clear the lower quartile on all five of its objectives
    against 99% of its own - the same "nothing passes on every count" symptom
    this sheet has had all along. Sorting is monotone in Pareto dominance, so a
    scheme better on every objective still wins outright; balance only decides
    the cases dominance leaves open, which is most of them.

    Two cells apart, the same scheme is a move along an axis and belongs on the

    is the same drawing printed three times, which is what happened the moment
    the ranking changed: `hollow_market_arch` took the arch cell, then took two
    more, and the sixteen tiles read as nine buildings.

    Both suffixes have to be cut, not just the coverage one. A siting copy is
    the same composition standing somewhere else, and keeping `^off_open` in
    the key made it a new family - so `plate_on_four_supports` printed twice on
    one sheet, and `lifted_back_court` twice more.

    The geometry signature cannot police that either, because it is what the
    coverage variants legitimately differ in - growing a scheme wider and growing it
    taller both change its proportions, so its own copies stop matching it. The
    name the variants were derived from does not move, so that is what is
    remembered across cells. Within a cell the signature still rules, since
