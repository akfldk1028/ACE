"""Bring BOOK-stack masses to the massv2 jury.

Two pipelines, one shared IR: book_language compiles its 70-principle
vocabulary into the same SourceMass that massv2's post-compile funnel
consumes. This tool replays a book run's exact geometry artifacts
(GeometryProgram AST -> SourceMass on this parcel's legal host) and
stages them as anonymous jury tiles - PROMPT.txt, tNN.png, key.json,
with three current board seats riding as anchors - exactly the stage
layout judge.sh/score.sh already speak. Book masses then face the same
blind eyes as every massv2 family, which is what "use the book" means.
