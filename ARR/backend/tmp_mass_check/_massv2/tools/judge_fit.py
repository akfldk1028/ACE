"""Which measurable objective tracks what the judges actually rank.

The selector's balance criterion (`select._balance_keys`) needs more than one
objective to mean anything, and the last two it had were removed because their
correlation with judged quality flipped sign between rounds: `far` at -0.23 then
+0.33, `shape_work` similarly, while `spoken_force` held at +0.67 and +0.48.
So a candidate axis is not accepted for being plausible. It has to survive two
rounds with the same sign and a usable size.

Judging is pairwise, not scored. MLLM-as-a-Judge (ICML 2024) reports pairwise
agreement with human ranking at 0.773 Pearson against 0.490 for absolute
scoring, and this package has watched a scoring round invert itself. Groups of
four give six implicit pairs each and stay close to pairwise reliability.

The prompt is written once, stored in `prompts.json`, and reused verbatim in
every round. ⚠️ A previous comparison was ruined by editing the prompt between
rounds - the judges' vocabulary went from 51 tags to 17 and the two rounds were
no longer measuring the same thing. Do not change the judge while comparing
judgements.

⚠️⚠️ And judge a sample that was not selected on the thing being tested. Run
against the delivered shortlist - which `choose` picks by `spoken_force` - two
independent rounds agreed that `spoken_force` correlates -0.39 and -0.32 with
judged quality, and that `slenderness` correlates +0.43 and +0.61. Run against
a sample drawn evenly across the whole compiled pool, with the identical prompt,
the same measurements came back +0.43 and -0.33. Both signs inverted.

That is selection, not disagreement: inside the winners of a contest decided by
X, the remaining variation in X is what the other criteria had to overcome, so
X reads as a handicap. Two rounds holding their sign proves the judges are
consistent. It does not prove the sample is.

`sample_pool.py` draws the unselected sample this tool should be pointed at.
