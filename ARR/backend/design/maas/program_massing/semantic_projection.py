"""Project anonymous source geometry into program-relevant spatial roles.

The source compiler deliberately describes formal operations (bend, court,
fold, terrace).  Program evaluation must not require those volumes to carry a
small, pre-agreed list of role names: that collapses an open language archive
back onto a few hand-authored seeds.  This module derives roles from geometry
and section relations, so reference/VLM-authored graphs remain evaluable.
