"""Verbs whose transform varies with height: a matrix per storey band.

A single 4x4 is linear, so a taper, a twist or a stair cannot be one matrix -
but each *band* of one can. The old implementations knew that and built the
bands by hand: read the volume's bounds, compute a width, a centre and an
offset, and ask the frame for new boxes. Every coordinate bug this package has
had came out of exactly that arithmetic - `_bounds_of` measured on world axes,
`_taper` and `_twist` handing world corners to `stack` after the axes changed,
`_grade` rebuilding from an axis-aligned box and inflating with the parcel's
bearing, `_shear` forgetting to add a volume's own position back and
teleporting it to the frame centre.

None of that arithmetic exists here. A band is derived from the volume's own
matrix in unit space - slice the unit cube, then let the matrix it already
carries put the slice where the volume already is:

    band_i  =  slab(i, n) . item.matrix

and the shaping transform is composed either in unit space (scales, which then
act along the volume's own axes whatever the parcel's bearing - rotation
invariance by construction) or in world space about a pivot taken from the
volume's own matrix (rotations, which must preserve angles and therefore
cannot be composed in a normalized space).

Which volumes, which operator, about what point. Same contract as `affine`.

    This verb existed once as a staircase and was reverted by measurement: the
    stepped approximation read worse the finer it was cut (5 steps 0.29
    articulation, 24 steps 0.09), and the memory of that revert is why the
    corpus said 박공 with nothing for two sessions. With `top_drop` in the IR
    the roof is two real planes: the volume is halved across the ridge in its
    own unit space and each half's top descends outward from the ridge, so the
    silhouette is the triangle a person draws when asked for a house.

    The ridge runs along the volume's own long axis unless `along: "cross"`.
    Legal counting stays on the full prisms - stricter, as everywhere.

    `pitch` is a slope - rise per unit of run, 1.0 is 45 degrees - not a share
    of the volume's height. As a height share it drew a 45-degree roof on a
    six-metre house bar and a five-degree tilt on a twenty-metre slab from the
    same word: the fused-gables sentence spoke 박공 and delivered a plane. The
    house unit already converts its geometry to a height share before calling
    `gabled_halves` ((d/2)/h); this verb now does the same per volume, capped
    at what the body can hold. And "long" means the volume's actually longer

    The section language cannot say this. `top_profile` is a height across the
    volume's own plan, so it can tilt a top and never push one past a wall -
    which is why this is a banding verb like `shear` rather than a roof verb
    like `gable`. Bands are slices of the volume's own unit cube, and the
    flight is a world translation composed onto the matrix each band already
    carries, so a volume keeps where it stood.

    The heel holds still. `aggregate`'s `reach` records why - a flight needs
    something under it - and every band steps the same amount past the one
    below, so the ratio the structure gate reads is constant however many
    levels are asked for.

    `reach` is bounded by the gate, not by taste. `structure` refuses a
    cantilever past `CANTILEVER_BACKSPAN_RATIO` of its backspan, which inverts
    to a step of r/(1+r) of the run; the ceiling here is two thirds of that,
    because the gate judges the *delivered* mass and the growth loop moves it.
    Measured on `aggregate`'s own `reach`: 0.28 came through delivery clean and
    0.35 measured 1.61 after growth, against a limit of 1.60.

    A second bound, on the composition rather than the member: n bands each
    stepping s put the centre of mass s*(n-1)/2 of the plan past its middle,
    and the ground contact reaches half a plan, so s*(n-1) must stay under 1.

    The flying band stays a room. Marked structure it would fall out of
    `plausibility`'s room count and into its holding weight, and a scheme whose
    upper half is a cantilever would be refused for being mostly structure -
    which is the one thing the word is for. VitraHaus, the Balancing Barn and

    The sawtooth, the concertina, the folded slab. It is the same primitive the
    gable and the mansard are - a piecewise-linear top across one axis - with
    more breaks in it, so it costs no new geometry either.

    One volume, not a row of them. `gable`'s `bays` cuts the body into separate
    strips with a ridge each, which is a different building: strips have gaps
    between them and a plate has creases in it. `gabled_halves` records what
    splitting a section costs - the coverage retarget scales each volume about
    its own centre and pulls the pieces apart.

    `folds` is capped by the drawing, not by taste. A profile with more points
    than `MAX_CREASED_PROFILE_POINTS` is read as a sampled curve and drawn
    without its seams, which is right for the vault's sixteen samples and would
    turn a concertina into a barrel. Folds take 2n+1 points, so the cap is what
    the renderer will still crease.

    The declared pitch is one facet's slope, so a body that folds three times
    does not get a roof three times as deep - the run per facet shrinks with
    the count, which is what a real folded plate does.
