"""Did the building do what the sentence said it did.

Everything else in this package checks the mass against the world - the law,
daylight, gravity, the parcel. Nothing checked it against its own sentence, and
that gap is why work on this language had become a sequence of patches: a
`split` whose halves stood flush drew a picture identical to the box it cut, a
two-metre `lift` under a twelve-metre plate read as a plinth recess, a `carve`
at the low end of its range came out as a skylight. Each was found by a person
looking at a PNG, forming a hypothesis and changing code.

The first version of this module asked the question per verb: what does a
`carve` leave behind, what does a `lift` look like. That was the same mistake
one level up. Four checks, and measurement corrected three of them in a single
afternoon - reading only for interior rings called every edge-notch silent,
demanding the raised plate be less than half held collided with the four
supports `lift` puts there itself, and requiring the sheared volumes to overlap
refused the strongest version of the move. Worse, `_shows_shear` passed
whenever a `split` had moved two parts apart, so it reported on a move that had
not happened and its numbers were never trustworthy.

There is only one question, and it does not need to know what any verb means:

    is the mass after this word measurably different from the mass before it?

`execute_steps` already stops the sentence after each word. Comparing those
frames answers it for every verb at once, including verbs added later, and it
cannot be fooled by a neighbouring move because the only thing that changed
between the two frames is the word being judged.

The check runs once per sentence, at the size it was authored. A verb that does
nothing here does nothing in every coverage and siting variant derived from it,
so judging the sentence is both cheaper and the right unit: silence is a
property of what was written, not of how large it was later drawn.
