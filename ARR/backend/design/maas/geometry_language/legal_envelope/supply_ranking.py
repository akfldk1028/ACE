"""Order a form supply so an early cut of it still suits the lawful ground.

Measured on PNU 1168011800104170004: the lawful ground is proportioned 1.606:1,
while the deterministic form bank's own seeds have a median plan aspect of 1.16
and 47 of 86 are effectively square.  More than half the supply is mis-
proportioned for the parcel before a single gate runs, which is why so many
poses cannot cover the required area and end up rebuilt by floorwise repair.

Ordering by proximity alone was tried and measured: it lifted program-gate
throughput by a third but narrowed the selected portfolio's aspect spread,
because a distance sort front-loads near-identical proportions. The order here
therefore leads with the lawful proportion and then disperses.

This module only *orders* the supply.  It never edits a program, drops one, or
selects a form: the same programs come back in a different sequence, so a
caller that ignores the ranking is unaffected and every downstream hard gate is
untouched.
