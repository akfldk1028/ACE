"""Draw sentences from the parcel instead of writing them by hand.

Seventy-six sentences was the whole vocabulary, and every one of them was
written against one parcel's facts - a skewed 2,500 m² plot that affords 4.2
storeys. Run on a 497 m² commercial site that affords sixteen, they filled ten
of the sixteen grid cells and their stated reasons were about a low building.
The masses adapted because the executor owns the metres; the reasoning did not,
because a person wrote it about somewhere else.

So the sentence is generated too. Not the geometry - that is still the
executor's, and not the syntax - that is still the corpus's. What is generated
is the choice: which operations, aimed at what, and why on this parcel. Every
magnitude here is read off the site (storeys the limits afford, how skewed the
plot is, how many boundaries a neighbour is already built against) and every
`why` quotes the number it came from, so a sentence is true where it was drawn
and nowhere else by accident.

This is the "sample more, reflect less" half of the harness. The literature is
consistent that for open-ended quality no critique loop beats simply drawing
more candidates against a sound verifier at equal budget, and the verifier here
- legal fit, physics, connectivity - is the part of this system that already
works.
