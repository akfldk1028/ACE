"""The architect picks: the grid proposes, a person chooses.

Blind judging measured the top of this pipeline's pool at roughly one
fault-free drawing in four, which is a normal hit rate for massing studies
and the reason the final say was moved to eyes (관8). This tool takes the
same principle one step further back: instead of shipping one winner per
cell, it renders the strongest few per cell as one gallery, so the person
the sheet is for can pick from the pool the machine would otherwise pick
from alone.
