"""Can this stand up. Asked of the geometry, not of the score.

Two measurements were reported as high-quality today and both were the same
mistake: `splayed_fan` came top of its cell on every number the sheet carries -
articulation 0.79, ground take 0.94, 용적률 0.98 - and reads as a collapsed deck
of cards leaning off a box. The critic named what the numbers could not, which
was that nothing holds the leaves up.

Adding a shape rule against that one drawing is how the last three rounds went:
"no volume more than 1.5x its neighbour" is a sentence about one symptom and
there is always another symptom. Physics is not like that. A cantilever has a
backspan or it does not; a body's centre of mass is over its support or it
falls. Those two questions are finite, they are the same two questions on every
parcel, and they are answerable from the band plans this compiler already has.

Mezghanni et al. (CVPR 2021) is the direct precedent and also the warning: they
measured a learned plausibility discriminator and a geometric-plausibility
function against physical stability and *both failed to predict it*, while an
explicit support-polygon computation succeeded. Geometric plausibility and
physical stability are not correlated. So this is computed, not scored.

The cantilever bound is a proportion rather than a dimension, and therefore
says the same thing on a 20 m parcel and a 200 m one. It is taken at the
generous end - what a storey-deep truss reaches, not what an ordinary beam
does - for the reason the span bound already states: this is here to refuse
the impossible, not to referee the ambitious. At the ordinary-beam value it
refused Milstein Hall and Seattle Central Library, both of which are built.

# Rhein, 2010), measuring ~1.45 of backspan in this gate's own band-wise
