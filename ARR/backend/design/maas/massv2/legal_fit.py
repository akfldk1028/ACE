"""Fit a form to the parcel by moving its volumes, not by carving the result.

The existing path searches for one global 4x4 pose for the whole rigid body, and
when it cannot find one it says `whole_solid_affine_fit_infeasible`, falls back
to clipping the solid against the legal prism with CSG, and then demotes what
comes out to `legal_analysis_proxy_only` - a mass that can no longer be rendered
or scored. Authored intent is spent to buy legality.

Here every volume carries its own matrix, so an offending volume can be reduced
or moved on its own and the rest of the composition survives untouched. Two laws
are enforced, in the order they bind:

  건축면적 - 건축법 시행령 제119조 제1항 제2호. The horizontal projection of the
  whole building, unioned over every height, against the parcel's BCR ceiling.
  Because it is a projection, only plan dimensions can pay for it.

  정북일조 - the legal plan shrinks as height rises. A volume is checked at the
  top of its own span, which is where it is tightest, and pulled in there.
