"""One table, read from the one file per word that MassAgent owns.

MassAgent is what generates a mass, so the language it generates in belongs to
it: `agents/MassAgent/book-language/verbs/<verb>.json` is the word - the BOOK's
own definition of it, the operator that executes it, and whether anyone has
read the rival implementation massv2 carries. Nothing here restates any of
that; it loads it. Adding a word means adding a file.

The table used to be `_BOOK_VERB_CANONICAL_EFFECT`, private inside
`geometry_language.book_adapter`, where the half of the system that needed it
most could not see it. massv2 wrote its own `carve`, its own `stack`, its own
`taper` - thirty-one words in all - and the two halves drifted until they
contradicted each other outright:

    BOOK: shear -> slice        massv2: shear pushes a volume sideways
    BOOK: skew  -> shear        massv2: skew leans it over
    BOOK: stack -> step         massv2: stack appends tiers beside the body

A sentence that says `shear` does not say which of those it meant, and neither
does the jury sheet that marks it down.
