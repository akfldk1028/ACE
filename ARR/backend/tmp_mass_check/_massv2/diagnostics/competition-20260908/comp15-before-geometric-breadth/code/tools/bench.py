"""A fixed set of masses, so two critique rounds compare the same buildings.

Two rubric-anchored rounds have now been run and neither could be read as a
before/after, for different reasons each time. The first pair was ruined by my
own prompt - asking the judges to reuse tag names took the vocabulary from 51
tags to 17 and every count moved for a reason unrelated to the masses. The
second pair used an identical prompt and was ruined by the pipeline instead:
fixing things changes which candidates win their cells, so the two sheets shared
only twelve of sixteen schemes and even those were different variants.

    round 1   sentence-contradicted 32   sentence-invisible 16
    round 2   sentence-contradicted 26   sentence-invisible 32

Something real is probably in there - four wrong-verb sentences were rewritten
between the rounds and `sentence-contradicted` is exactly what those were - but
it cannot be separated from the change in cast.

So this renders a named list, one drawing per sentence, always the same
sentences, with no selection in the loop at all. Coverage and siting spreads are
skipped and the mass is the sentence executed, grown to the site and clipped -
the delivered geometry, not the authored size, because that is where every
failure this branch has chased actually lives.
