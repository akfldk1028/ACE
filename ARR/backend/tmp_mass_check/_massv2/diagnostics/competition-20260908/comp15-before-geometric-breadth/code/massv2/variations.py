"""Move a composition to a different ground take without changing what it is.

The two axes are independent in a way the old language could not exploit. Ground
take is how much of the allowed footprint the building claims, and for a set of
placed volumes that is a plan scale. Void is a property of the composition - how
the pieces sit relative to one another - and plan scaling leaves it alone,
because scaling a figure and its holes together does not change the share of the
figure that is open.

So a courtyard scheme authored at one ground take can be carried across the
whole coverage axis, and the grid fills from the compositions that already
exist rather than from hand-authoring one scheme per cell. That is the
difference between a vocabulary and a lookup table.
