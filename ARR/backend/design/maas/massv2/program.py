"""The rooms the building is asked to hold, and what they do to its mass.

Two things make a mass, and this package has only ever had one of them. The
form language says which operations and where they aim; nothing said what is
inside. So every volume was the same kind of thing and the only reason one
could be larger than another was a ratio the corpus fixed - which is why the
hierarchy had to be legislated (`MIN_TIER_CONTRAST`) instead of arriving on its
own, and why thirty-six sentences from three offices whose work looks nothing
alike came out at four to six comparable pieces each.

A room schedule gives it for free. A 주민센터 with a 400 m² 다목적실 and a
60 m² 사무실 has a dominant volume because the brief has one, and the large room
needs six metres of clear height where the others need three, which decides
what can sit above what. In Korean competition practice that schedule is not a
designer's choice at all: the 공모지침서 issues 실별 소요면적표 and the entry is
judged partly on matching it.

This module is the second track. It does not replace the form language - a
parti still says stack, shear, carve and where - it supplies the metres those
verbs act on, so the same sentence can be run form-first or programme-first or
anywhere between.
