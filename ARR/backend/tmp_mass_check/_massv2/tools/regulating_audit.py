"""How few lines explain where every part of a mass sits.

Akin & Moustapha watched six architects mass a building for two hours each
(Design Studies 25(1), 2004) and found one mechanism structuring all of it:
regulating elements - symmetry axes, centres of rotation, alignment lines. What
they let an architect do is add and remove masses freely while the underlying
structure survives, and that survival is what separates a composition from a
pile. `massing-study/our-gap.md` states the test this repo needs and never
built: *can a small set of axes explain the placement of every part-mass? Few
elements for many parts = composed. Many or none = a pile.*

This is that test. Every body's plan edges are clustered into lines by bearing
and offset, and the smallest set of lines that touches every body is found
greedily. The number reported is bodies per line: a composition where five
bodies all sit on two axes reads as one building, and five bodies needing five
axes is five buildings sharing a plot.

One-body masses are excluded rather than scored 1.0 - a single volume has
nothing to regulate, and counting it as perfectly composed would drown the
measure in the 65% of the corpus that delivers one body.
