"""Generate grammar-valid sentences at base-volume scale.

The authored corpus explores the language a few sentences at a time; the
combinatorial space of (opener x profile x modifier verbs x params) is tens
of thousands. This generator samples that space wide - seeded, reproducible -
and keeps ONLY what the living validator accepts, so correctness is owned by
the validator (which derives verbs/params from the executor), not by tables
here. The whole point is the funnel: generate wide, let the gates and cells
and juries pick the good ones.

Sweep books are written OUTSIDE inputs/ on purpose: the corpus glob
(inputs/gen-*.json) is the authored canon, and a thousand generated sentences
must not join it. Winners get promoted by hand into inputs/gen-sweep-picks
after a jury - the same door every sentence walks through.
