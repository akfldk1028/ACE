"""Shared, coordinate-free view of the lawful buildable field.

`geometry_language/` is a flat module folder; this package exists so the legal
envelope stops being private knowledge of one consumer.  Anything that decides
form — the live LLM author, the deterministic form supply, scheduling — should
read the lawful field through here rather than re-deriving it.

Nothing in this package may emit parcel coordinates, a finished mesh, or a
named building form.  It publishes relations only.
