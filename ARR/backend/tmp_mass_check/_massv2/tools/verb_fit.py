"""Which sentences use verbs that cannot say what they claim.

Four of these were found one at a time by looking at drawings, and each cost a
round trip: `gable` (a prism language has no pitched roof), CCTV's `loop` (rings
a court in plan, cannot stand one up), CopenHill's `taper` (narrows on every
side, so it builds a ziggurat rather than a one-way slope), and Sendai's `carve`
(reaches in from an edge, so it makes a recess rather than a tube).

They share a shape, and it is the one no gate can see: every word does change the
mass, so the diff check passes, the gap check passes, the physics passes - and
the mass is simply not what the caption says. `sentence-contradicted` was the
critics' most frequent fault by count, and this is where it comes from.

So this reads the principle and the gesture as text and asks which verbs could
possibly carry the claim. It is a screen and not a verdict: a hit means go and
look, and the rule that applies is the one this package has learned four times -
measure before changing anything, because two of the four candidates it flags on
the current corpus turn out to be arguable.
