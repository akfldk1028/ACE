"""Diagram-derived semantics for the architect-supplied BOOK.

The BOOK is not a flat list of attractive labels.  Each base operative is a
three-part grammar: choose a relative base volume and orientation, perform one
spatial action, then explore bounded variations of the action.  This module
keeps that evidence separate from parcel coordinates and compiler geometry.
