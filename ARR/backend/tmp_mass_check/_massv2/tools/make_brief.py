"""Assemble an author brief from its owners - no hand-typed numbers, no

The brief is derived, per the one-owner rule: trap numbers come from
trap_ledger (which reads the gate constants), the vocabulary and canon are
included verbatim from their files, and the board section lists the current
board's sentences from the curator's own key - so the "differ from all of
these at the level of formal principle" demand (NoveltyBench's best-in-class
regeneration, canon §10) always names today's board, not a remembered one.
