"""Does the extreme a sentence declares survive to delivery?

A sentence that says "three corners pressed to the ground and one drawn up
to the extreme" is making a measurable claim: the tallest body should stand
several times the shortest. The postcondition gate only asks whether each
word changed the form at all, and spoken_force asks how much of the volume
a word accounts for. Neither asks whether the *ratio the sentence names*
arrived. via57 declares 6x and reads, on the sheet, as a box.

This walks the delivered picks and puts the two numbers side by side:
declared contrast (read off the operation arguments) against delivered
contrast (tallest body over shortest, measured on the geometry that shipped).
