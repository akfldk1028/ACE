"""Measure a form the way the earlier mistakes proved it has to be measured.

Two measurements were wrong today and both were wrong the same way. Unioning
every triangle of a mesh into an orthographic silhouette hid concave cuts,
because the cut face projects into the pocket it opened. Unioning every volume
regardless of height hid courts, because whatever sits above an opening closes
it again. Five of ten operatives read exactly 0.000 open under the second one.

So nothing here flattens. Convexity is measured per band against that band's own
convex hull, and openness against that band's own tightest rectangle - tightest
rather than axis-aligned, because an axis-aligned box makes a plain rotated
solid read as 0.52 open at 45 degrees, which is orientation, not void.
