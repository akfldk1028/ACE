"""MASS v2 - masses authored as placed volumes carried by 4x4 affines.

The existing language is face operations on a single solid, and measurement put
its ceiling at roughly 0.29 departure from the mass's own convex hull. This
package authors the other thing the repo already knew it wanted: several clean
volumes, stacked and shifted.

Public surface is deliberately small.

    place / Placement / MatrixForm   author a mass
    compile_matrix_form              -> SourceMass, no 3D CSG
    measure_form                     convexity, grid cell, band profile

Nothing here writes a geometry identity hash, and nothing sets
`geometry_authority` to one of the authored values that arm the certification
layer. That is deliberate: it keeps this package outside the identity contract
while the form language is being proven.
