"""Capacity feedback for executable continuous-field mass graphs.

The language author owns the path and topology. This module only projects an
under-capacity ``bend`` genotype toward a measured FAR target by changing its
bounded occupiable width/section parameters. It contains no parcel coordinates
or named-building templates and may be replaced by a learned optimizer later.
