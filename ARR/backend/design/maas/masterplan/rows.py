"""Row-and-aisle parking candidates chosen by an objective, not by site rules.

Every candidate is one through aisle (a band) with a stall row on each side, an entrance
corridor from an allowed road edge to one end of the aisle, and - when a basement is wanted -
a straight ramp leaving the aisle at right angles. The engine enumerates aisle orientations
(every site and footprint edge direction), aisle positions (0.5 m steps across the free
ground), entrance ends and ramp positions, builds each exactly, and scores it:

    score = stalls_placed - w_aisle * aisle_length_m
            - w_access * mean distance of accessible stalls to the entrance
            + w_edge   * (aisle parallel to the longest allowed road edge)
            + w_beside * (ramp touches the plate but runs beside it - the basement stays under the plate)
            + w_far    * ramp at the aisle end away from the entrance (cars pass the rows first)
            + w_under  * share of the ramp under the plate (off by default)

The weights are parameters (defaults below); nothing here names a parcel. What practice plans
do - long straight aisle, rows both sides, ramp off the aisle beside/under the plate - is what
this objective rewards, so it emerges on any parcel where it fits. The planner validates every
candidate independently afterwards.

# w_beside: the ramp runs beside the plate (touching, mostly outside it) so the basement floor under the

# surface rows first. w_under kept for reference, off by default.
# THERE IS NO `w_loop`, ON PURPOSE. A loop's worth is not a constant: on a generous plate it costs
# nothing and on a tight one it costs a whole basement level, and which of those is true is a fact
# about the parcel, not a number to type here. Pricing it at four cars was wrong on both counts - it
# was invented, and on 고산 the measured price was twelve. The loop is therefore measured (`terms`
# carries `closed_aisle_loop` and `loop_length_m`) and decided by comparison: `basement_layout.rank`
# takes it when it costs no cars, and `planner.rank` takes it when it costs no level and no
# excavation. When it costs more, the plan says what it would have cost.
