Each of these says the same three things - which volumes, which operator, about
what pivot - and `_operate` does the rest. Nothing here computes a width or an
offset by hand, which is the whole point: the bug that lost the corpus its
articulation was one verb rebuilding a volume without adding its own position
back, and there is no place to make that mistake here because no verb rebuilds
anything.
