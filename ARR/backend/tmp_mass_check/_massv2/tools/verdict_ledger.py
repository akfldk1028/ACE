"""What the judges keep saying, gathered where the next author must read it.

The refusal ledger feeds gate lessons back to authors; the juries' words
went nowhere - '규모 과대' was written eleven times before anyone put it in
a brief. This walks every judged round (runs/vlm-*/ with key.json and
r*.txt), joins tiles back to sentences, and emits a per-sentence digest of
the weakest axis with the judges' own clauses, plus the round VERDICTs.
make_brief includes the result verbatim; nothing here is hand-typed.
