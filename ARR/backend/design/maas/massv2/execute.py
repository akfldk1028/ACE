"""Apply a parti to a site and get placed volumes.

The executor owns the metres. An author writes "stack three, shear toward the
open side, carve a court to the south" and never states a dimension, because
every dimension here is either the parcel's or a ratio the corpus fixes. That
split is the whole point of the grammar: the author supplies the sentence, and
the sentence is about this site; the executor supplies the syntax, and the
syntax is the same everywhere.

Which is why nothing here can be tuned into a house style. The offsets are
0.15-0.35 of the volume's own dimension because below that an offset reads as
a setting-out error and above it the volume stops reading as displaced. Tiers
contrast because three offices whose work looks nothing alike never once built
a mass of equal blocks. Volumes hold a joint instead of merging because that is
how two enclosures meet. What differs between two runs is which operations were
chosen and what they were aimed at, and both of those come from the parcel.

    Akin & Moustapha watched six architects mass a building and found the one
    mechanism structuring all of it: regulating elements - axes, centres,
    alignment lines - which let masses be added and removed while the structure
    underneath survives. This language had half of that. `_Frame.regulates`
    stores the lines, the site gives `spine`, `cross` and `street`, a `split`
    registers its own cut and a `carve` its court - and the only reader used a
    named element as the **pivot of one operation**. A shared pivot is not a
    shared alignment, and measured over the corpus it showed: 118 masses of two
    or more bodies, median 1.00 bodies per line, not one reaching three. Every
    part sat on its own line, which is the definition of a pile.

    This is the missing half. It slides, it does not turn: a volume with a face
    running within `_ALIGN_PARALLEL_DEG` of the line is brought until that face
    lies on it, and one standing askew to the line is left exactly where it
    stood. Turning it would be a different word - the sentence can say `rotate
    about:` for that - and a verb that quietly reorients what it was asked to
    align is the class of surprise this package keeps removing.

    The test is the bearing modulo ninety degrees, not modulo one-eighty, and
    that is deliberate: a volume square-on to the line has faces parallel to it
    at both ends, so a bar lying across a street still has a street-facing end
    to bring up to the kerb. What it excludes is the volume at forty-five
    degrees, which has no face to offer and would have to be turned.

    A volume that cannot be aligned is left alone rather than approximated, so
    the silence gate is what reports it. Same rule `cantilever` follows when a
    body is too short to fly.

    underneath, and a person is the same height on every site. Kaktus, Grove
    and Grace Farms all lift by 0.15 of their height, which is ten metres or
    more on the buildings they were measured from; the same ratio on a 12.6 m
    parcel is 1.89 m, a crawl space. All three came back silent on every one of

    So the ratio sets the intent and the floor-viability minimum sets the
    dimension. A building too short to give that clearance and still be a
    building simply does not get lifted.

    The same argument bounds it from above, and only the floor was there. On a

    undercroft standing on 4 m sticks - and the plausibility gate let it pass,
