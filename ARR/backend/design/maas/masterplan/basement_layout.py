    A slab grown outwards as a buffer hull can close an aisle loop only if it happens to come out

    be at least two modules (2 x (stall + aisle + stall) = 32 m with 2.5/5.0/6.0 m rules) plus the
    cross aisles; cutting the plate to n whole modules makes that true BY CONSTRUCTION instead of by
    luck. This is the proportioning rule practice works to - CCDC controls the overall width of a
    parking structure as a multiple of the bay width, and Xu Han-zhe et al., J. BUPT 42(4):102-108
    (2019) plan the perimeter ring first and decompose the interior afterwards.

    Returns plates inside `envelope` that still cover `mandatory` (the ramp and obstacles), n modules
    deep across the bands, at the three depth positions that matter - flush with each end of the
    mandatory and centred on it - and, when a `target_area` is given, cut to the width that meets it
