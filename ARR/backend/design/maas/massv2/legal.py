"""The parcel's own limits, fetched once and handed to the form language.

This adapter combines the existing legal stack (Vworld boundary, zoning,
setbacks, sunlight, and legal floor fields) with source-registered parcel plan
controls owned by parcel_policy. Cartographic registration is reported as such;
it is not a measured survey or complete permit assessment.

There is no synthetic fallback. A parcel that cannot be resolved raises, rather
than quietly handing back a rectangle that would make every downstream number
meaningless.
