"""Does the coverage axis have a rung inside the winners' envelope?

Measured on runs/uij-aim: a sentence's variants sit on one curve, because the
composition's floor area is fixed and only the ground take moves. site_best_notch
delivers 386 m2 at 13.0 m on the dispersed band and 519 m2 at 9.0 m on the held
band - the envelope wants 400-800 m2 *and* 10-20 m, and the two rungs step over
it. 35 of 116 standing families show the same straddle.

The rungs are 0.45 / 0.65 / 0.85 / 1.00 of the certified 건폐 capacity, so the
step from the first to the second is 1.44x, and height moves inversely by the
same factor. This runs a family through extra rungs and prints what each one
actually delivers, so the axis can be re-spaced on measurement rather than on
the ratio arithmetic.

The run is named so the brief travels with the probe. Without it the first
version measured a 3,581 m2 building against a row describing 1,550 - the korea
edition sizes a scheme to its 실별 소요면적표 before the bands, and a probe that
skips that step is not measuring the grid's building.
