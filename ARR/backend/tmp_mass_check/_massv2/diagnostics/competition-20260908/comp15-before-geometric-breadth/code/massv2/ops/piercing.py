"""The book's Intersect: a second volume driven through what is standing.

"관통 교차하다 - 두 볼륨을 서로 관통시킴". Both volumes stay solid - this is
not a cut. Puncture takes material away; Intersect adds a body that passes
through and sticks out both sides, which is Kunsthal's ramp, CCTV's sky lobby,
Vitra's stair bar. The corpus has wanted this word for three sessions: the
Kunsthal sentence wrote "경사로가 상자를 관통하며" and the screen flagged 관통
as a claim no verb could carry, so the sentence had to be rewritten to say
less than the building does.

The bar is aimed and sized off the target's own matrix corners - which
volumes, which operator, about what point - and built through `frame.box`,
which is already one matrix composition. A climbing pierce is banded along its
own length with the same `_slab(axis=0)` discipline as `bend`: each segment a
flight, translated up in the bar's own unit space, so the ramp is flats of
real floor rather than a smoothed lie. The stepping is honest: these are the
landings a built ramp has, not an approximation of a plane the language
cannot say.
