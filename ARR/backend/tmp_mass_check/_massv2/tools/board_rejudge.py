"""Re-judge the board's overseas seats after a renderer or executor change.

Rule 0 says a changed drawing is re-baked before anyone looks; its corollary
is that a changed drawing's SCORE is stale too - the cylinder tower's 3.00
was judged in the scaffolding the smooth renderer has since removed. This
stages the current board's O entries as anonymous shuffled tiles under the
overseas rubric; three blind judges score them, and the result joins the
curator's rounds as a corrected pass (newest-last overrides).

      -> runs/vlm-<round-name>/ : tiles + PROMPT.txt + key.json
