"""The BOOK's aggregation layer: four words massv2 never had.

Pages 50 to 58 of the BOOK are not base operatives. They are the layer where a
word takes an operative and repeats or joins it - `reflect` with expand and
skew on 50 and 51, `pack` with inflate and branch on 51 to 53, `array` with
rotate, taper and pinch on 55 to 57, `join` with pinch and split on 57 and 58 -
and this grammar could say none of them. Thirty-one of the BOOK's thirty-five
words had a massv2 implementation and these four had nothing, which is not a
category of word that cannot be reconciled; it is four words nobody wrote.

Each is the standard operation its own file names, and none of them is exotic:

    array     one transform applied n times, each instance the accumulated image
    reflect   a 4x4 with determinant -1 about a plane - volume preserved,
              handedness reversed
    pack      n solids placed inside a container without overlap
    join      a union of two solids plus the connector between them, so what
              was two components comes back one

They are written here rather than in `relational` because the BOOK keeps them
apart, and because what they take is a whole composition rather than a host and
a guest.
