"""The base shape a matrix carries, when a square is not what the plan is.

A 4x4 affine can pose anything, but it can only pose what it was given: with a
unit square as the only primitive the vocabulary can say tower, bar and slab and
nothing else. Qatar National Library is a folded plate, the Kunsthal a wedge,
Kanazawa a circle - those are different base shapes, not different transforms.

So a placement carries a normalized unit plan and the matrix does the rest. The
profiles are the repo's own `PROFILED_PRISM_FAMILIES`, normalized into the unit
square so `scale_matrix4((w, d, h))` means the same thing for every one of them.
Nine shapes already agreed on inside this project beats nine invented here.
